# Portfolio
This is my public portfolio for the course Telling Stories with Data at CMU!  Here's where all my cool work from the class is. 

# About me
Hi folks, my name is Abigail Hartless (she/her) and I'm a second-year masters of arts management student at Carnegie Mellon University's Heinz College. My background is in theatre and instrumental music, but I fully switched into theatre about four years ago. I'm the managing director of our on-campus student theatre group, meaning I'm in charge of all things finance. 

# What I hope to learn
My background is in language and writing, and I have a bad habit of data dumping. I'm looking to learn new ways to communication financial information to arts folks without scaring them (arts people are often scared of finance). I'm also excited to create data visualizations to help my writing and communication projects.

## Assignment: [Visualizing Government Debt](visualizing-government-debt)

## Critique by Design: [Critique by Design](critique-by-design)
For this assignment, make sure you set up and link to a new page.  This page is linking to a new Markdown document called `critique-by-design.md`.  

## Final project
I looked at theatre funding from 2018-2023 to investigate trends in contributed income and demonstrate that federal funding is not as crucial for theatres as some administrators may believe.
