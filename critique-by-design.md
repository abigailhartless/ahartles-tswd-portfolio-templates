# Title
Makeover Monday: Caffeine Levels in High Street Coffee Vary Signficantly, Which? finds

## Step one: the visualization

Here is the link to the original visualization and data source: https://www.which.co.uk/news/article/caffeine-levels-in-high-street-coffees-vary-significantly-which-finds-ay7cA4G1zh1S

When initially looking at the visualizations, I was drawn to the caffeine content of popular brands, as I was curious if it would confirm some suspicions I had. When looking at the initial visualization, it was just a table, leaving not too much to edit, but more to create something from scratch. I knew I wanted to sort everything by brand, and have everything on a spectrum. 

## Step two: the critique

The visualization left a lot to be desired, as the bright blue made it harder to see the text, the data was in a table, and then lots of White, or blue space, was taken up by a graphic of coffee cups, which was cute, but did not contribute to the story of the table or to the overall article.

## Step three: Sketch a solution
Here are my two initial hand sketches, which I presented to my group members for interviews. 

## Step four: Test the solution

I presented both sketches to my teammates, and incorporated most of their feedback.

I asked them what they thought the graphs were showing, which one they preferred, and if they had anything they wished was displayed differently. 

They liked the distinction between the type of drink and the brand, which I decided to keep. In my hand sketches, the brand name and amount of caffeine were on the same line, which they noted caused confusion. They also suggested I think about a bar chart, to show comparison between individual drinks for each brand. They also suggested I incorporate the logos of the brands, but I decided not too as they are not US based brands, and therefore not as recognizable logos to my audience of peers.  My peers were of similar age to myself (early to mid-20s), and in the MSPPM and MISM-BIDA programs, so I had a variety of perspectives different than my own to incorporate. I am grateful for their feedback and ideas!

## Step five: build the solution
Below is my final visualization (created with Datawrapper) 

<iframe title="Starbucks has the least caffeine: comparing caffeine in High street coffee" aria-label="Dot Plot" id="datawrapper-chart-I8yrY" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/I8yrY/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="204" data-external="1"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var t in a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r,i=0;r=e[i];i++)if(r.contentWindow===a.source){var d=a.data["datawrapper-height"][t]+"px";r.style.height=d}}}))}();</script>

After conducting interviews, I tried to create my tables in Tableau. I had some difficulties editing my data and my computer is a little finicky
with Tableau, so I decided to switch to Datawrapper, to try the software I was less familiar with, and as my data was not sensitive. I briefly
viewed the Makeover Monday recreations, but was unable to fully watch the video as I was backstage while working. I also decided that I wanted
to tell a slightly different story than the visual in that video, and wanted to present that Starbucks had the least caffeine, rather than what
quantity falls within the safe daily caffeine consumption level that I initially thought I would pursue. 

I made a few changes from my initial thoughts based on peer feedback and my playing with Datawrapper and Tableau. Given my timeframe, I wasn't
able to create coffee cup shapes without incorporating some sort of AI, which I generally hesitate to use. I kept my initial spectrum idea, but
broke it into brands based on interview feedback. I also color-coded each drink type, but did not incorporate any coffee colors because shades
of brown are hard to distinguish. 

Overall, I think it would've been easier to create something that started with a visualization that wasn't a table. However, I appreciated the challenge, and feel much better about using both Tableau and Datawrapper.
