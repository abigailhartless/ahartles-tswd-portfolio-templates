# User research 
Because it is most important to tell arts administrators that theatre is not as reliant on federal funding as they may think, I decided to split my interviews into my Telling Stories with Data classmates, and my peers in the arts management program. I conducted interviews with three peers in my section, and then with four peers in arts management on break for another class, all who had previously taken Telling Stories with Data. 

## Target audience
Based on my part 1, I know that my presentation and project will have two separate audiences. My in-class presentation will have an audience base of theatre patrons, and then my part 3 final Shorthand buildout will have an audience of arts administrators. Because federal theatre funding has more of an impact and needs more of an explanation to administrators who are not always aware of the true effects of funding and governmental actions, I feel that it’s important for that to be my final product, yet to tailor my in-class presentation to my classmates to explain the situation that is going on in the field. 

## Interview script
As my final document and class presentation will have two different audiences, I split my questions to cater to each audience. Luckily, when interviewing my arts management classmates, they had all taken the course before. 

| Goal | Questions to Ask to classmates|
|------|------------------|
|  Ensure classmates are engaged   |  Do you feel well informed about how US theatres are funded?                             |
|  have classmates think like arts managers  | Do you as a theatre audience member have any concerns about how funding cuts will impact your attendance of shows?                 |
|  Ensure classmates will be engaged & feel empowered    |   What do you feel is missing from the story |

| Goal | Questions to Ask to MAMs|
|------|------------------|
|  Ensure classmates are engaged                         |  What do you feel is missing from the story                                    |
|  have classmates think like arts managers              |  What do you feel is most important for arts managers to know?                 |
|  Ensure classmates will be engaged & feel empowered    |  What do you feel is most important for theatre audiences and patrons to know? |



## Interview findings

Based on my interviews, my classmates suggested I include information about the average NEA grant size to theatres. They also reminded me to consider the effect of color in my Shorthand, which I had not changed from the templates, and to consider re-ordering my 2018 and 2023 charts based on the point of the story I’m trying to tell about the historical federal funding changes for theatre. My classmates were the ones who pointed out to me that it might be more effective to split my presentation based on my audiences, to highlight the difference in story that is present between the two groups of arts managers and my classmates. 


# Identified changes for Part III
I will set the scene with my class presentation by asking my peers to assume that they understand how theatres are funded. I also will make my script, andn


| Research synthesis   | Anticipated changes for Part III  |
|------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| shift coloring of templates to align with theme | will shift and choose colors after I incorporate my visualizations
| include average grant size to organizations  | might include -- will depend on timing; most arts managers will already know|
| don't linger too much on how theatres are operating | maybe? will need to think about this  |
|  switch ordering of 2018 & 2023 to align with story |   most likely, need to make sure it lines up with my narrative 
| use theatre photos | will be using my own theatre photos, will get to go through them all as a treat as one of my last steps |
