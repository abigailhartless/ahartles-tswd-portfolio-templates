# The final data story
Here is the link to my final Shorthand presentation
(https://carnegiemellon.shorthandstories.com/theatre-funding-trends/index.html)

# Changes made since Part II
I had quite a few changes since finishing part 2. First, between finishing part 2 and creating my final shorthand document for my in class presentation, I realized that the story I needed to tell was a little different, and that instead it was important for me to highlight the decrease in contribtued income from 2022-2023. While it is still important for theatre administrators to know that they are not as reliant on federal funding as they may think, they are increasingly reliant on other forms of contributed income, and it is crucial for them to invest in their development staff and teams, and support them through an increasingly difficult contributed income situation. 

First, I added in my own theatre pictures to the presentation. These were mostly pictures that did not include sets, which are often copyrighted, and for the one that did include a set, it is a show that has closed and is no longer under copyright. 

I then added in a quick breakdown of what is considered earned and contributed income, partially for my classmates, and sometimes because not every theatre administrator is aware. After my presentation to my peers, I added an excerpt about what the contributed/earned breakdown usually looks like. 50/50 is a safe bet for an average theatre, although this can vary a lot. 

Next, I created my two key visualizations. First, I created my rainbow bar graph in Raw Graphs to highlight the variety of contributed income sources. Because I did not create an account in RawGraphs, I lost my key to the colors, other than that black is federal funding. However, because the different sources of contributed income vary so widely between theatres, and are primarily dependent on the location of the theatre, the exact key is not crucial to understand the graph -- all that is necessary to know is that black is federal, and the different colors are the variety of contributed income sources that vary widely based on theatre. 

When creating my line graph in Tableau, I went back and forth on whether my comparison should be contributed income, or all income (earned and contributed). When I realized what an important part of the story contribtued income was, I decided to make it contributed income. I considered incorporating trend lines for each source, but as that variety was already displayed in my bar chart, and not crucial to my story, I decided not to include it, because it wasn't crucial to the story. 

## The audience
My audience has always been theatre administrators, as a lot of theatre administrators in the highest positions come from the more artistic side of things, and are less aware of how their theatres are funded. While many theatres have two-pronged executive teams with an artistic director and an executive director, the current shifts in federal guidance surrounding DEI programs are increasingly making a lot of theatre makers anxious that they will have to change their work, to abide by these federal rules. However, most theatres are not reliant on federal funding, and therefore do not have to follow the federal government's anti-DEI measures. Because so many administrators aren't aware of this, it was important to me to educate these administrators, and share with them that they can continue to highlight this important work, especially in a period of time where many are trying to silence it. 

## References
There are no additional references from the ones I used in my Shorthand. I did use all of my own images, since sometimes theatres can be a little finicky with image copyright in regards to sets (that I mentioned above), and I cited those at the end of the presentation. 

## AI acknowledgements
I did not use any AI, except for any built into Raw Graphs that was used when creating my one bar chart. 

# Final thoughts
Overall, I feel really good about how my part 3 came together, and it resonating with my intended audience of theatre administrators. For another class, I've been researching censorship in theatre, and I think I can incorporate this story with that one, to demonstrate theatres aren't necessarily subject to censorship on the basis of federal funding restrictions. I also think this is a good skeleton that I can adapt to describe a singular theatre, which will be helpful in my job search as I'm hoping to work in theatre finance, and also update to include new data as TCG continues to come out with annual theatre facts reports. While it is always difficult to present my work in classes without a lot of arts managers, having lots of MAMs and MEIMs in this course made me feel more confident when presenting. I was happy with how well I did time-wise, but that is a result of theatre people never having too much time to listen to presentations :).
